# ansible-ntp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/ansible-ntp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/ansible-ntp) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/ansible-ntp.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/ansible-ntp/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Installs NTP on Linux.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    ntp_enabled: true

Whether to start the ntpd service and enable it at system boot. On many virtual machines that run inside a container (like OpenVZ or VirtualBox), it's recommended you don't run the NTP daemon, since the host itself should be set to synchronize time for all it's child VMs.

    ntp_timezone: Etc/UTC

Set the timezone for your server.

    ntp_manage_config: false

Set to true to allow this role to manage the NTP configuration file (`/etc/ntp.conf`).

    ntp_area: ''

Set the [NTP Pool Area](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/NTPPoolServers) to use. Defaults to none, which uses the worldwide pool.

    ntp_servers:
      - "0{{ ntp_area }}.pool.ntp.org iburst"
      - "1{{ ntp_area }}.pool.ntp.org iburst"
      - "2{{ ntp_area }}.pool.ntp.org iburst"
      - "3{{ ntp_area }}.pool.ntp.org iburst"

Specify the NTP servers you'd like to use. Only takes effect if you allow this role to manage NTP's configuration, by setting `ntp_manage_config` to `true`.

    ntp_restrict:
      - "127.0.0.1"
      - "::1"

Restrict NTP access to these hosts; loopback only, by default.

## Dependencies

None.
